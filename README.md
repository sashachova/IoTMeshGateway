# Introduction
Now a wide variety of IoT devices running on different technologies and protocols. They can use wireless technology (wi-fi, Bluetooth, ZWaiv, NFC, etc.), or wired technologies (Ethernet, OneWair, I2C, SPI). These devices can control other physical devices, or be terminal primitives.

But the lack of common standards limits the ability to use all IoT devices that exactly needed in a particular situation.

Gateway - project, which was created for combining different devices running on different standards and protocols, and to help them communicate with each other.
